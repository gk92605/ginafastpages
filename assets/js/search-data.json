            "content": "About . This notebook is a demonstration of some of capabilities of fastpages with notebooks. . With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .

            "title": "Lit Weekly Participation 8_22 26",
            "content": "AP Literature &amp; Composition: Weekly Participation Assignments . This week in AP Literature and Composition, I gained more experience on analyzing characters and understanding their meaning to the bigger picture of the story. We annotated four short stories, all covering topics that relate to bigger issues in society and people that represent diverse people of the world. Such as in the short story, “The Tell-Tale Heart” by Edgar Allan Poe, Poe utilizes first person point of view to represent the thought process of a psychopath, while not justifying his actions. By using descriptive language to bring the main character’s heightened emotions of panic, fear, and anxiety to life, so that the audience will get to live through them as well. Then, we also analyzed “Girl” by Jamaica Kincaid and studied what the girl and second voice in the short story meant. We connected the writing to the societal standards that have been long placed on young girls and how they struggle to break out of it because they’re questions of society are quickly shot down. Our group concluded our discussion onto a single document, Speaker Analysis Chart, where we analyzed that the Point of View of “Girl” was written in was 2nd person with consciousness filled in because of the feeling that we the reader is the girl being reprimanded on how to act and that the point of view of “The Tell-Tale Heart” was 1st person so that the reader would understand the panic and confusion the character faces. Doing the chart with my group and then expanding the conversation with the class allowed me to recognize how interpretations of certain things can vary so much. For example, I had never considered the heart in “The Tell-Heart” to symbolize anything except for maybe guilt, but hearing others talk about their perspectives, such as someone mentioning that it could resemble anxiety, opened my eyes to the world of personal interpretations. This was continued in the individual readings of “LUSUS Naturae” and “The Interpreter of Maladies.” When first reading these alone, I was only able to scratch the surface of what the authors intended and what certain things meant, but as I discussed with my group, we were able to point out specific instances or aspects of the story that I hadn’t noticed before. Having people notice something new about the characters or plot, such as the symbolism of the monkeys in “The Interpreter of Maladies,” allowed me to look at the text in a new light and create completely new interpretations of the author’s meaning. Also filling out the Character analysis chart helped me recognize the importance of the supporting characters and their impact in creating the theme of the story. Despite disliking certain characters, such as the mother and sister in “LUSUS Naturae” and Mrs. Das in “The Interpreter of Maladies,” looking at every aspect of their lives the author intended to know helped me recognize that they were needed in creating the full story and message. This carried on onto our Friday Literary group talks as we read the same text, but created various meanings and important aspects of the power of text and literature. Throughout this week, I was able to learn a lot about how to look deeper into characters in order to understand their meaning and connect them to the bigger picture. .",

            "title": "Hello to Python",
            "content": "Hello, World! . These examples show the basic language structures and constructs of Python using print and input commands (aka anatomy). . Print command using Static Text which performs output . The classic introduction to a programming language is to output a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; message. In Python, this is a print statement. . The command or function is print() | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a String literal. This is the referred to as Static text, as it does not change. | &quot;Hello, World&quot; is a parameter to the print command. | The print command outputs the parameter to the terminal, as you see it in this Jupyter document | Output in Jupyter Notebook is below the code cell. Output will vary depending on tools and development intentions. Python print typically outputs to a terminal, we will see that when students start using Visual Studio Code. | . print(&quot;Hello World!&quot;) . Dynamic example showing variables, input and output . This second example is a sequence of code, two or more lines forms a sequence. This example takes input from the user and stores the input into a variable called msg (short for message), then outputs the msg to terminal. - This example is Dynamic as the input and output can change each time the code is run. . A variable &quot;msg&quot; is part of both statement The variable &quot;msg&quot; is used to capture the input command | The variable &quot;msg&quot; is then used as a parameter to print command, causing input to be output to terminal, or in Jupyter Notebook below the code cell. | . | The &quot;input&quot; command activates the jupyter notebook input box, which obtains input from the user (try it!) the &quot;msg&quot; variable is the dynamic result of the input command | . | The print command outputs the &quot;msg&quot; variable captured in the input statement note, msg is a parameter to the print function | . | Input and Output in Jupyter Notebook Input is NOT in line with Output, this is a little annoyance and requires familiarity. Input and Output will vary depending on tools and development intentions. Python print typically obtains input and outputs to a terminal, students will see that when they run Python programs using Visual Studio Code. | . msg = input(&quot;Enter a greeting: &quot;) print(msg) . Building a Function . This example adds to the basics of the Python anatomy, a function. Input, output, and grouping commands in functions is the key to most programming languages. This example simulates a free response answer to a question. . The &quot;def question_and_answer(prompt)&quot; now contains multiple indented commands, the commands print and input were learned previously. | Grouping a sequence of commands, often used repeatedly, is called procedural abstraction. | Procedure, Function, def are all synonyms in the Python language. | The &quot;def&quot; is a key word in Python that defines a function. Using this keyword defines a group of commands, but does not run them initially. | The name of the function in this example is &quot;question_and_answer&quot;. In essence, we are defining our own command within the Python language. | The three &quot;question_and_answer&quot; commands that follow the function and indented commands allow this function to be run. | This code of the function is then run multiple times, each command line providing a unique &quot;prompt&quot; as a result of the literal parameter passed to the function. | The function takes a parameter called &quot;prompt&quot;, which is a message output to the user to describe the input requested. | String concatenation &quot;+&quot; prefixes the prompt with the literal message &quot;Question: &quot;. | The &quot;msg&quot; variable is captured as a result of the jupyter notebook input supplied by the user | The input &quot;msg&quot; is output back to the user with &quot;Answer: &quot; concatenated to the front. | . def question_and_answer(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() print(&quot;Answer: &quot; + msg) question_and_answer(&quot;Name the Python output command mentioned in this lesson?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;If you see many lines of code in order, what would College Board call it?&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Describe a keyword used in Python to define a function?&quot;) . Imports, Selection, and Logical Expressions . In Python anatomy of you will be importing libraries and functions. This is code that is developed by others. In this example we are importing from a library called &quot;os&quot;, this library extracts properties from the operating system of your existing system. Additionally, this example uses the custom function defined earlier in the Jupyter document. Python and Jupyter docs requires you to reference imports and definitions above the referencing line of code. . import os, sys obtain functions and variables from running environment | print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable + &quot; on &quot; + sys.platform + &quot;!&quot;), is a concatenated statement that outputs properties from the import | . Next, this example defines a new function &quot;question_with_response&quot;, this function returns a value input by the user. This allows programmer to evaluate the response. The purpose of obtaining the return value is to evaluate if correct response was given to the question. . response from &quot;question_with_response&quot; is captured in a variable called &quot;rsp&quot; return command in function returns msg input by user | assignment to &quot;rsp&quot; is allowed a function is returning a value, names do not need to match (but could) | . | if command is next command in sequence after &quot;rsp&quot; assignment this command contains an expression, rsp == &quot;import&quot; which compare what is typed to the string literal answer | an if expression is evaluated for true or false | true takes branch of code directly under if | false takes branch of code directly under else command | . | . The grand finally of this example is calculating the right/total. . question = 3 is defined as number of questions | correct = 0 is defined as running score | correct += 1 is the way to add one to the score, this code is placed in sequence under correct expression evaluation | since question and correct are numbers, versus strings, to place them in concatenation in print statements you must inclose them in Python function str() which turns number into string. | final print statement is concatenated and formatted to give user and right over wrong | . import getpass, sys def question_with_response(prompt): print(&quot;Question: &quot; + prompt) msg = input() return msg questions = 3 correct = 0 print(&#39;Hello, &#39; + getpass.getuser() + &quot; running &quot; + sys.executable) print(&quot;You will be asked &quot; + str(questions) + &quot; questions.&quot;) question_and_answer(&quot;Are you ready to take a test?&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to include other functions that were previously developed?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;import&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;What command is used to evaluate correct or incorrect response in this example?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;if&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) rsp = question_with_response(&quot;Each &#39;if&#39; command contains an &#39;_________&#39; to determine a true or false condition?&quot;) if rsp == &quot;expression&quot;: print(rsp + &quot; is correct!&quot;) correct += 1 else: print(rsp + &quot; is incorrect!&quot;) print(getpass.getuser() + &quot; you scored &quot; + str(correct) +&quot;/&quot; + str(questions)) .

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs. This code works off of the server endpoint/url, not from code cells above it in this notebook. . To work with this code and make observation for learning... .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.
