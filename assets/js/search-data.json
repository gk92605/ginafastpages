In this data example, we are going to make &quot;the best computer jokes ever ;)&quot; and serve them over the Internet. The ultimate objective is to allow our viewers to provide a like or dislike on each of our jokes. . This code planning begins by coming up with some jokes and defining a data &quot;model&quot; to keep and manage the jokes. . jokes_data contains a list of dictionary records containing joke and reactions:haha or boohoo - joke_list contains collection of jokes we will put into jokes_data | . | Next comes some functions to interact with our jokes . def initJokes(): initializes jokes_data | def getJokes(): returns the complete list of jokes | def getJoke(): returns a single joke from our list | ... many more function can be examined by reading comments below ... | . | . import random jokes_data = [] joke_list = [ &quot;If you give someone a program... you will frustrate them for a day; if you teach them how to program... you will &quot; &quot;frustrate them for a lifetime.&quot;, &quot;Q: Why did I divide sin by tan?

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs. This code works off of the server endpoint/url, not from code cells above it in this notebook. . To work with this code and make observation for learning... . Run a local server from flask_portfolio project and the change server variable to be local | Observe the requests endpoints and the output, see if you can observe what is happening/changing on put requests | The &quot;requests&quot; are captured into a List, the List is used in the for loop to extract from RESTful API format. | Try running this with Debugging and observe what data is being created at each step (Required) | Try to format this data in Python print statements to be more readable (Required) | Start and stop local server and observe errors | . # server = &quot;http://127.0.0.1:5000/&quot; # run local server = &#39;https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/&#39; # run from web server url = server + &quot;api/jokes/&quot; responses = [] # responses list # Get the count of jokes on server count_response = requests.get(url+&quot;count&quot;) count_json = count_response.json() count = count_json[&#39;count&#39;] # Update likes/dislikes test sequence num = str(random.randint(0, count-1)) # test a random record responses.append( requests.get(url+num) # Get/read joke by id ) responses.append( requests.put(url+&quot;like/&quot;+num) # Put/add to like count ) responses.append( requests.put(url+&quot;jeer/&quot;+num) # Put/add to jeer count ) # Get a random joke responses.append( requests.get(url+&quot;random&quot;) # Get/read a random joke ) # Cycle through and print responses for response in responses: print(response) try: print(response.json()) except: print(&quot;data error&quot;) .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon.
