Each week, you will actively participate in our course, most importantly sharing your ideas about what we read and write, as well as listening to and asking thoughtful questions of your fellow classmates. . Despite Common Core Standards requiring student voice and discussion, our class depends on you! Literature is meant to be shared, discussed, argued over. Each of you reads the text from different viewpoints, life experiences, and personal philosophies. Only when we interact with each other – see the text through different eyes – do we begin to fully understand it. . Weekly Participation Assignments: . Each week you will be required to write a reflective paragraph on what you have learned this week. In the paragraph, you will make references to your engagement and participation in the class to receive full credit. The examples can be references to discussion boards on your Group Canvas page, notations from the readings or lectures, or assignments from the week of study. They can also be references to the comments you or other students made during discussion or the chat. . Participation Rubric: Participation and class discussion is worth 20% of your grade for this course. . Your participation is worth 10 points each week. Please see the rubric below for grade breakdown . Strong &amp; Meaningful . (10 pts) . Basic . (7 pts) . Not Participating this Week . (3 pts) . .

Weekly Participation Writing Examples . Example of a mix of connections to class work and class insights: . Throughout this past week, I’ve realized how important our backgrounds and identities are when it comes to interpreting and understanding pieces of literature. I was first introduced to this concept when we looked at The Beatles lyrics and discussed within our groups and as a class what we thought the meaning of the song was. For the first song, “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,” my group believed it was about a little girl who died and went to heaven, and I assumed most groups would have similar interpretations of the lyrics. Instead, not a single group had the same interpretation; instead, theories ranged from the writers being on drugs to the idea of childish imaginations. I also realized the way we understand and bring meaning to texts often doesn’t align with the author’s intended purpose or meaning, which is why it’s important to analyze literature on your own before consulting the internet or discussing with others. Ultimately, it’s crucial to form your own understanding of literature to be able to form your own meaningful connection to it. . I also gained a lot of insight on the role that point of view plays in literature. In the case of an unreliable narrator, such as in “A Tell-Tale Heart,” we could see how the narrator’s delusion and insanity created a different kind of storytelling than a normal narrator would. His repeated attempts to convince the reader of his sound mind and trying to relate with the reader regarding his motivation for murder do the opposite of what he intended; the more he tries to directly characterize himself as sane and wise. He only convinces the reader more of his insanity. I found this particularly interesting because I was able to gain a unique understanding of the narrator’s mind and see how he not only tries to rationalize his actions but is also convinced of his own brilliance, and I tried to convey this in my Speaker and Characterization Analysis Chart. I was able to further explore the role of perspective in the short story “Lusus Naturae.” Atwood uses the point of view to create sympathy, “I no longer had to worry about getting in the way of other people and their futures” (235). As can be seen here, a girl with a disease that turned her into a monster, is still a very sweet and innocent girl throughout her difficult life in which she is shunned by her family and society and bears the hurt entirely on herself. As I worked through my Character Analysis Chart, I realized how ironic it was that the monster was the only character that was empathetic and kind, while all the normal humans exhibited no real traits of humanity. In this way, the point of view from which the story was told is monumentally important to the story because if the story had been told from her mother’s or sister’s perspective, we likely would have sided with them and missed the underlying message about the importance of empathy towards everyone. . Example with direct references of literary analysis: . This week in AP Lit, I got an exposure to short stories and a broad variety of literature. We began with the story “Volar” where I took a deep dive into what it means to truly analyze literature. Something different that I tried to do was rather than in APEL, where I would scan for rhetorical devices, I tried to look at why the author was saying what they were instead of how they were saying it. I used to isolate the rhetorical strategies into their own mini “passages” and analyze them as separate works. This week, I really tried to look at the prose as a whole and put it in relation to the author’s background and life experiences. For example, when the author wrote, “I had a recurring dream in those days: that I had long blond hair and could fly,” I was able to understand that she is picturing an idealistic version of herself through flying, an inhuman characteristic. However, I didn’t pick up on the aspect of the quote where she wished she had “long blond hair,” for in the class discussion I became aware that the author had a Hispanic background, thus imagining herself as the “ideal American girl.” The next readings we explored were “Girl” and “The Tell-Tale Heart,” both for which we completed a speaker analysis. The power of the point of view came to light for me, something I had merely dismissed as a literary device in the past. The power of the stream of consciousness was especially apparent in “The Tell-Tale Heart” where the narrator’s thoughts were presented unfiltered. For example, when the main character exclaims, “Ha!– would a madman have been so wise as this?” the author speaks to the reader itself, interjecting this phrase amidst his description of the man laying on the bed. He is trying to prove something to the audience, but in actuality he is slowly trying to convince himself. This point of view made it obvious as the main character was driven into insanity, and I would not have noticed this without our discussion on the reliability and effectiveness of the narrator. Had the story been from the old man’s, or the policeman’s point of view, we would not have learned these things about the narrator. From this we transitioned onto character analysis in the stories: “The Headstrong Historian” and “Lusus Naturae.” I explored the idea of how a character’s central values contribute to the overall theme of the novel. For example, Grace, the daughter of Nwamgba, cherishes family and stays connected to her culture. This is exemplified when she changes her name back to Afamefuna, commenting on the story’s theme that one culture and family take precedence overall. The contrast between Grace and Michael, or Anikwenwa is stark, demonstrating the negative effects colonization and loss of culture has on an individual. I am not very used to analyzing characters and their developments, since I am more familiar with nonfictional works. Thus, picking apart the actions of every character, since every word and action speaks volumes to one’s principles and ideals. Finally, in our literature circles, I dived into the world of Shakespeare and read the beginning acts of Macbeth. Interpreting Shakespeare is something that has always been difficult in my eyes. I had to read the text several times to capture the meaning of the scenes. The novel also gave me insight into the role that fate has in one’s life. Even when we become aware of our fate, it can change everything, such as how it is beginning with Macbeth. By looking at what each character was contributing to this determined theme, I was able to make better sense of the complicated script. The activities and readings of this week exposed me to a variety of topics in literature, all equally important towards furthering my success as a reader and even a writer. By picking apart these themes and characters, their actions and words, thoughts and ideas, central values and relationships, I am better able to make sense of the fictional world I am slowly getting more used to. .",

Backend Interface for Web API (Control) . An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs. This code works off of the server endpoint/url, not from code cells above it in this notebook. . To work with this code and make observation for learning... .

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. .
